 * bundle that carries no Developer ID, and these builds carry none — signing
 * costs an Apple Developer membership, which is the same reason `install.sh`
 * exists at all. So the whole of the update story here is: ask GitHub what the
 * latest release is, compare it against this build, and run the very script the
 * README already tells people to paste into a terminal. Nothing is downloaded
 * in the background, nothing is staged, and there is no delta.
 *
 * The one thing this process does fetch is the `.dmg` itself, and only once the
 * button is pressed (`downloadUpdate`) — because the download *is* the wait,
 * about a hundred megabytes of it, and it is the one phase the window is still
 * alive for. `install.sh` quits the app before it copies anything, so a
 * percentage is honest up to there and nothing after it could be drawn at all.
 *
 * Free of `electron` — this process's own version, and where the script it runs
 * lives, are arguments — so `test/updates.ts` can import it under plain `bun`,
 * the same bargain `git.ts` makes.
