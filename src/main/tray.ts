 * The menu bar's count of what the chats are doing, and the way back to one.

 * The studio is a window somebody walks away from — several chats answering at
 * once is what it is for, and the cost of that is that the only two things
 * saying "one of them wants you" were a banner that has already gone and a
 * sidebar row inside the window that was walked away from. This is the third:
 * a standing count in the strip that is on screen whatever is in front of it,
 * and a menu naming the chats behind the number.
 *
 * It draws `activityLabel` — the sidebar row's own label, from
 * `@shared/chat-activity` — deliberately, and that is the whole reason those
 * two functions are shared: the count out here is checked against the count in
 * there, and two formats would read as two different facts.
 *
 * Nothing here polls. It is redrawn from `ChatNotices.pending()` on the same
 * events the notifications are read off, which is the only thing in this
 * process that knows a chat is busy.
