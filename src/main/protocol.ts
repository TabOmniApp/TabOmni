 * a file on disk that could say anything. Nothing here builds a path from what
 * arrives.
 *
 * `net.fetch` on the file rather than reading it: the response streams, and the
 * content type comes off the extension the same way it does for the renderer's
 * own assets above, so an `img` gets `image/png` without a second mime table
 * in this app.
 *
 * The `Range` header is passed along, and that is not incidental: a `<video>` in
 * a note asks for the head of the file and then for the bytes around wherever
 * the reader drags to, and `net.fetch` given a bare URL sends none of the
 * request's own headers — so a player that could not seek was the failure to
 * avoid here.
