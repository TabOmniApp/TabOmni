/**
 * What makes hovering an import say something.
 *
 * The Explorer's editor is Monaco, whose TypeScript worker knows exactly one
 * file: no `tsconfig.json`, no `node_modules`, no other file in the repository.
 * That is enough to colour and to parse and nothing else — hovering an import
 * gets `any`, and go-to-definition on it goes nowhere. What answers those
 * properly is a TypeScript *server*, which is why one runs here.
 *
 * **tsserver directly, not a language server.** `typescript-language-server` is
 * a translation layer over exactly this process, and translating LSP into
 * tsserver's own protocol only to translate it back into Monaco's providers is
 * a dependency to carry, install and keep in step for no answer it could give
 * that this cannot. tsserver's protocol is newline-delimited JSON in and
 * `Content-Length`-framed JSON out — the whole client is the file you are
 * reading.
 *
 * **The folder's own TypeScript, and no other.** A repository pinned to 5.4
 * should be read by 5.4: its `tsconfig.json` may use options a different version
 * rejects, and the types it resolves are the ones its own compiler resolves. A
 * folder with no `typescript` in its `node_modules` gets no hovers and no
 * go-to-definition, which is deliberate — shipping a copy would add forty
 * megabytes to the download to serve a project that, having no TypeScript
 * installed, has no types to resolve either. It is the same bargain the
 * Terminal panel makes with the `claude` CLI: use what the machine has.
