/**
 * A swordsman drawing and cutting — the chat's "a turn is running" indicator.
 *
 * It is **the GIF itself**, animated by the browser, and that is the whole of
 * the mechanism: there is no CSS for this component and `styles/motion.css` has
 * nothing left under `yasuo`. It replaced first a hand-drawn SVG and then a
 * spritesheet cut from this GIF's predecessor, and `docs/design.md` § The chat's
 * loading indicator carries both reversals.
 *
 * Three things the GIF costs, none of them fixable from here:
 *
 *  - **`prefers-reduced-motion` cannot touch it.** A GIF's clock is the decoder's,
 *    not the compositor's, so there is no rule to write. The SVG dropped its
 *    choreography under that setting and the spritesheet could at least be slowed
 *    to a third; this plays at one speed for everyone. Stopping it would mean
 *    shipping a still frame as a second asset.
 *  - **It does not follow the theme.** The SVG's blade was `fill-foreground` and
 *    its body `fill-muted-foreground`, so it stayed legible whichever way round
 *    the theme put them. These frames are fixed colours — near-black hair, a dark
 *    brown topknot — so the figure is at its weakest on a dark background.
 *  - **The figure has no feet**, because the source is cropped at the shins. It
 *    stands on the bottom edge of its own box.
 *
 * **The dead space is cropped in CSS rather than out of the file.** The GIF's
 * canvas is 640x270 and its drawing occupies 433x230 of that, so 42% of the frame
 * is empty and most of it is a margin down the left-hand side. Left alone at 28px
 * the figure is 24px tall and sits 17px right of its own box, which in a flex row
 * reads as a broken gap. So the `<img>` is oversized inside a clipping box and
 * pulled back into place — every number below is a percentage of the *content*
 * box, which is what keeps the crop correct at any height the caller asks for.
 * Re-encoding the GIF would have been tidier and was not done: cropping it means
 * writing a GIF encoder, and this is four numbers.

/**

 * the thirteen frames, and a crop that fits the figure clips the swing.
