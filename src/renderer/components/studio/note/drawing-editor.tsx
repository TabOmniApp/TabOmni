 * sketched — an outline that wobbles off true and a hand-drawn font — which
 * reads as charm on a whiteboard and as a badly drawn rectangle on a diagram of
 * an API. Roughness 0 is the straightest of the three it offers, and Liberation
 * Sans is a label meant to be read rather than admired.
 *
 * These are the studio's, not the drawing's, and so are forced over whatever a
 * scene was saved with, exactly as `theme` below is. The cost is that changing
 * the sloppiness or the font inside a drawing lasts as long as that drawing is
 * open and no longer; the alternative — a default that only applies to a canvas
 * nobody has saved yet — leaves every drawing made before today sketched, which
