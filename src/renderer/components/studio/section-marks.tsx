/**
 * The four ways into the studio, and how each is drawn.
 *
 * Data rather than a component, and its own module because six other files
 * want the hues and the icons — the pane's empty states, the sidebar headers,
 * the Settings dialog. It has now outlived two bars that were named after it:
 * the activity rail, and the row of tabs on the right-hand panel that replaced
 * it. The lists live in two places today — Database, Notes and API are sections
 * of the left column, the Explorer is the right-hand panel — and a hue that
 * says "this is a table" is the same hue wherever the table is listed.
 *
 * Ordered the way the work goes: the folders themselves, then the data and the
 * endpoints behind them, then the notes about all of it.
 *
 * **There is no Terminal section**, and there is no Terminal panel either: a
 * shell is a tab of the dock, pointed at whichever project was last clicked,
 * and an agent's work happens in a worktree's chat — which draws in a pane of
 * its own with no sidebar of its own.
 *
 * Explorer is first because it is the workspace's own contents — the folders
 * every other panel is about — and because it is the section somebody reaches
 * for without having decided what they are doing yet. Notes sit last because
 * they are about all of the others rather than beside any one of them.
 *
 * `Icon` is typed by the one prop the tabs pass rather than as a Lucide icon,
 * so a hand-drawn mark could sit beside the glyphs. The ids themselves are
 * `SECTION_IDS` in `lib/rail.ts`, which is what `Pane` is built from — this is
 * that list with a label and an icon against each one, and the type below is
 * what keeps the two in step.
