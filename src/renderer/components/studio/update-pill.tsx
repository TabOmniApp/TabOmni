/**
 * "Update to 1.0.20", in the status bar, and the sheet that explains what
 * pressing it does.
 *
 * In the footer beside the machine's meters rather than as a banner over the
 * workbench, and for the same reason those are there: this is a thing to
 * glance at. A release is not an event in whatever the user is in the middle
 * of, and an app that says so by covering the composer has misjudged whose
 * time is whose. The pill is gone entirely when there is nothing to install —
 * "you are up to date" is not news, and Settings › Updates is where somebody
 * who wants to hear it anyway can ask.
 *
 * The confirmation is not ceremony: the install quits the app. Anything
 * unsaved in a terminal or a running process goes with it, and a one-click
 * pill that did that without saying so would be a trap.
