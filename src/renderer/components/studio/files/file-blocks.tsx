/**
 * A `.note` or a `.md`, in the Notes panel's own block editor.
 *
 * The same `BlockEditor` the Notes panel mounts, so there is one prose editor in
 * the studio and one slash menu to keep in step — what differs is where the
 * document lives and what it is written back as. A note in the Notes panel is a
 * record under `~/.tabomni` that the notes store writes as it is typed; these
 * are files in one of the workspace's folders, so they go through the files
 * store like every other tab: typing marks it dirty, ⌘S and the header's Save
 * write it, and closing the tab flushes it. That is the Explorer's bargain
 * rather than the Notes panel's, and it is the right one here — the file is in
 * somebody's repository, beside their source, and a rich-text pane that wrote to
 * it on every keystroke would be committing to their working tree while they
 * thought.
 *
 * **The two files are not the same bargain, though, and the difference is worth
 * knowing before choosing this over the text editor.** A `.note` holds the
 * editor's own block document, so what is saved is exactly what was on screen. A
 * `.md` holds markdown, and BlockNote's markdown export is lossy by its own
 * documentation — children of blocks that are not list items are un-nested,
 * some styles are dropped — and it prints the *whole* file from the document, so
 * the first save reflows every line whether or not it was edited. Nothing is
 * written until there is an edit, and the text editor stays the default for a
 * `.md`, which is what keeps this a choice rather than a surprise.
 *
 * **Two parts of a `.md` do not go through the editor's own schema at all**,
 * because the document has no shape for either and a save would take them out
 * of the file:
 *
 * - Its **frontmatter**, which arrives as the two-column table at the top and
 *   goes back out as YAML. `lib/files/block-doc.ts` takes the block off the
 *   front of the file and `lib/files/frontmatter.ts` decides whether it is flat
 *   enough to be rows — a nested map or a list over several lines is not, and is
 *   carried around the editor untouched the way all of it used to be.
 * - Every run of the file with **HTML** in it, held verbatim in a read-only
 *   block — `note/raw-html-block.tsx` and `lib/markdown/raw-html.ts`.
 *
 * Drawings and dropped pictures are off for a `.md` for a third reason — see
 * `workspaceFiles` on `BlockEditor`.
