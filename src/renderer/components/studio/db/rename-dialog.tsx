/**
 * Renames something that has a name and an `alter` behind it — a table, a
 * column — from wherever the rename was asked for.
 *
 * Mount it only while renaming (`{renaming && <RenameDialog …>}`): the current
 * name seeds the field once, on mount, rather than being kept in sync with a
 * value the user is in the middle of editing.
 *
 * Also the "name this new thing" dialog, with `currentName=""` and its own
 * verb: asking for a name and asking for a different name are the same field,
 * the same validation and the same way of reporting that the name is taken —
 * see the Explorer's New file. Only the button says which one it is.
 *
 * The name opens **selected**, so the first keystroke replaces it: this is asking
 * for a different name, and a caret at one end of the old one leaves it to be
 * selected by hand before that can be typed. All of it, since nothing this
 * dialog renames has an extension — a file does, and a file is renamed in its
 * row in the tree rather than here (`files/file-tree.tsx`).
