 * A markdown file's frontmatter as rows, and the table the block editor shows

 *
 * `block-doc.ts` takes the block off the front of the file byte for byte, which
 * is what keeps a document with metadata from coming back as three horizontal
 * rules — read that first. This file is the next question: having taken it off,
 * can it be shown as something other than a line saying it is not shown? A flat
 * block of `key: value` lines can, as the two-column table GitHub draws for the
 * same bytes, and that is nearly all frontmatter in practice. Anything with
 * shape to it — a nested map, a list over several lines, a block scalar — cannot,
 * and says so rather than being flattened into rows that would be printed back
 * as something else.
 *
 * Everything here is text and plain objects, so it is testable under `bun` with
 * no DOM: `test/frontmatter.ts`. Getting it wrong is quiet and destructive in
 * the same way `splitFrontmatter` is, and for the same reason — the file's
 * metadata is what a site build, a docs pipeline or a skill loader reads it for.

 * One row: a key, and its value **exactly as it was written**, quotes and all.

 * `true` is a boolean and `1.0` is a number — so a value read out of quotes and
 * printed back without them changes what the file means, and one read as a plain
 * `1.0` and printed back quoted changes it the other way. There is no way to
 * tell those apart from the text alone once the quotes are gone, so they never
 * come off: what the table shows is the source, and what is printed back is the
 * source unless the user typed something that would not survive as it stands.
 * `plainValue` is for the one place that only reads — the preview.
