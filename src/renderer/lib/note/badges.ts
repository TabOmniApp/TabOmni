 * for the browser at all: `serverSide: true`, filtered out of the picker, there
 * to render an export on a server. Nothing preloads it, because `loadSceneFonts`
 * only loads what a scene already contains — so the first text measured with it
 * was measured against whatever the browser substituted, and when the real file
 * finally arrived `Fonts.onLoaded` dropped the caches and re-fitted every bound
 * label, moving boxes that had already been put down. Which is what made this

 * has not fetched yet, and the width and height it came out with were wrong.
 *
 * A **bound** label would have recovered: `Fonts.onLoaded` re-fits those when
 * the real file lands. A standalone text is only re-rendered, never
 * re-measured, so the wrong size is the size it keeps and the digit sits off
 * its circle for good. Hence loading it up front rather than fixing it after.
 *

   * container and then re-fits the label to it, growing the container's height
   * and its width in two separate branches when the text no longer fits — one
   * axis at a time, which on a circle means an oval, and a digit that stays
   * 20px however small the circle gets. `resizeMultipleElements`, which is what
   * a group goes through, does neither: `keepAspectRatio` is forced the moment a
   * selection holds a text element or anything grouped, so the circle cannot be
   * squashed, and `isTextElement` there scales `fontSize` with everything else.
   * A badge resizes as one object, without holding Shift.
   *
   * What the group gives up is nothing: a standalone text that is centred and
   * middle-aligned re-centres itself on edit — `getAdjustedDimensions` offsets
   * it by half of what it grew — so 9 becoming 10 stays over the circle.
