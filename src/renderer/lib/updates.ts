 * what the answer is allowed to do to the window. Both of those are deliberate:
 *
 * - **Once at launch and then every six hours.** A release is cut a handful of
 *   times a month, so anything more often is asking GitHub a question whose
 *   answer cannot have changed. The anonymous API also allows 60 requests an
 *   hour per address, and this app is not the only thing on a developer's
 *   machine spending them.
 * - **Nothing ever pops up.** The answer becomes a pill in the status bar, and
 *   a section in Settings for somebody who came looking. An update is not an
 *   interruption — the app was doing something when the check came back, and
 *   whatever it was, it was more important than this.
