 *
 * Narrower than Vite's own signature on purpose: every call here is eager and

 * error instead of a broken box at runtime. Declared here for the same reason as
 * the glob above: narrower than taking all of `vite/client`, and narrower still
 * than that — only the extension actually imported, so a second picture in a
 * second format is a compile error asking to be declared rather than a silent
