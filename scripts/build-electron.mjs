 * build a `require` of its own. esbuild's CJS output turns `import.meta` into
 * `{}`, so that becomes `createRequire(undefined)` — which throws the first time
 * the SDK uses it. The define below points it at a real file URL instead.
 *
 * It is bundled rather than left external because `files` in package.json is
 * `dist-electron` and `dist-renderer` only: a `require` of node_modules
 * resolves in dev and is missing from a packaged app.
 *
 * Its own build rather than a field on `shared` because the banner cannot go
 * near the preload: that script is sandboxed and has no `require` of node
 * builtins, so a `require("node:url")` at the top of it would fail before
 * anything else ran.
