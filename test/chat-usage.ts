/**
 * What a turn cost: the read of it, and the words for it.
 *
 * Worth a test for the reason `chat-activity.ts` is: both halves read something
 * this app does not own. `usageOf` reads the SDK's result line, which reports
 * per-model totals that have to be summed rather than picked from — a turn that
 * ran a subagent spent what the subagent spent — and reports zeroes for a turn
 * that crashed, which must not be drawn as a turn that was free. The renderer's
 * half is a percentage over three numbers, and the case that matters is the one
 * the whole feature exists for: a prompt that was written to the cache rather
 * than read from it.
 *
 * `SDKMessage`'s result type is deliberately not imported: these are the fields
 * this app reads, and a fixture built out of the SDK's own type would be a test
 * that only checks the parts of it we already believed.
