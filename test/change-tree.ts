/**
 * The Changes list's tree: which rows a pile of git paths becomes.
 *
 * The failures worth a test here are the quiet ones. A directory chain folded
 * one step too far loses the level a file sits at; a path from outside the
 * checkout filed under a folder it is not in is a row that lies; and a
 * directory's counts are the one number in the panel nobody can check by eye,
 * so a binary file blanking a folder's `+112 −8` would go unreported. Pure, so
 * this asks without a store or a repository.
