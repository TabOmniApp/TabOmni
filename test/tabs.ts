/**
 * The workbench tab strip's ordering.
 *
 * The strip is one row over four panels, each of which owns only which tabs it
 * has open — so where a tab sits relative to another panel's is held apart from
 * all of them, written once when a drag lands and reconciled against reality on
 * every render afterwards. That reconciliation is what breaks quietly: it is
 * asked about a saved order that may name tabs that have since closed, and
 * about tabs opened since that the order has never seen, and a wrong answer is
 * a tab that jumps or disappears rather than an error.
