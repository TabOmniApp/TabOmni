/**
 * What git says about a folder's files, against a real repository.
 *
 * Built rather than sampled, for the same reason the transcript and SMTP tests
 * are: the thing being relied on is git's own output, and a fixture would only
 * prove this file agrees with itself. So a repository is made in a temporary
 * directory, put into each of the states Explorer draws a colour for, and read
 * back through the function the IPC handler calls.
 *
 * `parseStatus` is exercised directly for the one shape that is awkward to
 * arrange and easy to get wrong — a rename, which is two records where every
 * other entry is one.
