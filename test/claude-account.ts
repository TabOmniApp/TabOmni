/**
 * Whether a profile's directory is signed in — the badge in Settings › Claude.
 *
 * Tested for the reason `mcp-servers.ts` is: every field here was written by a
 * process this app does not control, and the badge is what somebody trusts
 * before starting a turn under an identity. The cases that matter are the ones
 * the CLI is free to change under us — a login with no subscription, a status
 * that is not JSON at all — and the one distinction the section exists to
 * draw, which is that "not signed in" and "no such directory" are different
 * problems with different fixes.
