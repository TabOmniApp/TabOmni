/**
 * The pieces of the updater with an opinion: which of two versions is newer,
 * which asset in a release is this machine's, and what a half-finished install
 * says on the button.
 *
 * Worth a test rather than a glance, because both ways of getting it wrong are
 * silent. Say `1.0.9` is newer than `1.0.19` — string comparison, the obvious
 * implementation — and every user is offered a downgrade forever. Say a
 * prerelease is newer than the release it precedes and the same thing happens
 * to whoever is running one.
