# percentage, then hands the file over. The file is deleted afterwards.
#
# The download is the point of this script. macOS puts `com.apple.quarantine`
# on anything a browser, Mail or AirDrop hands over, and Gatekeeper refuses a
# quarantined app that carries no Developer ID — which these builds do not,
# since signing one costs an Apple Developer membership. `curl` sets no such
# attribute, so an app installed this way opens normally. That is a check being
# skipped rather than passed: what you get is the integrity of the transfer,
# not proof of who built the file. Read this script before running it.
